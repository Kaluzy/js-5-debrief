## In this exercise you will create your own random name generator!

### **Directions:**

### _Create a Random Name Generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript._  

### **Your application should meet the requirements listed below:**

1. Selects from a pool of at least ten names of your classmates
2. A `Generate Random Names` button that initiates the selection of 4 random names.
3. The selected random names are displayed to the browser. 
4. Each time the `Generate Random Names` button is pressed, a new set of names appears (replacing the previous set of 4 random names)
4. A button named `clear`  that removes the populated list from the screen
4. The application should be designed to be visually pleasing. Note: Do not spend too much time on design. Focus primarily on functionality(i.e. steps 1-5).





## Part 1 - Fork and Clone the project

* Begin by _forking_ this project into a personal repository.
   * To do this, click the `Fork` button located at the top right of this page.
* Navigate to your github profile to find the _newly forked repository_.
* Clone the repository from **your account** into the directory on your computer that you use to keep your projects (ex. `dev` directory).
    - Remember this from the lessons on Git and Github?
        - Go to the green `Code` button in the top right of this repository
        - Select `https` and then COPY that url
        - Open Git Bash on your computer, `cd` to a directory where you wish to save this assignment to work on
        - Type `git clone ` followed by the URL you copied from Github
        - `cd` into the repository for this assignment that you have just cloned.
* Open the newly cloned project in a code editor (ex. Visual Studio Code). 

### Part 2 - Edit the _cloned_ project

* from a text editor (i.e. - Visual Studio Code, Notepad ++, etc...), select:
  * `File` > `Add Folder to WorkSpace`
    * Select the directory you use to store your projects (ex. `dev` directory) 
    * From the text editor,in the directory you use to store your projects (ex. `dev` directory), locate the newly cloned project folder.
    * Expand the project from the _project explorer (may just be called `explorer`)_
    * Modify the `app.js`file to complete the assignment.
    

### Part 3 - _Pushing_ new changes to repository

* From a _terminal_ navigate to the root directory of the _cloned_ project.
* From the root directory of the project, execute the following commands:
    * `git add .`
        * Add all files in current directory to the staging area       
    * `git commit -m 'I have made an edit to a file!'`
        * Save all staged changes to local repository
    * `git push -u origin main`
        * Push changes from local repository to remote repository

### Part 4 - Submitting assignment

* From the browser, navigate to the _forked_ project from **your** Github account.
* Click the `Pull Requests` tab.
* Select `New Pull Request`
